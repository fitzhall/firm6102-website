        <h1>I lost my entire Bitcoin stash.</h1>

        <p>Not to a hacker. Not to a faulty hardware wallet.</p>

        <p>I lost it to something much more common, and much more dangerous:</p>

        <p><strong>Bad management. My own.</strong></p>

        <p>And it sent me down a rabbit hole that completely changed my life.</p>

        <p>Let me be straight with you:</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I had a problem you might recognize if you're a Bitcoiner who's been in the game for a while.</p>

        <p>You've built real wealth. You've seen your net worth do things you only dreamed of.</p>

        <p>But there's a nagging, gut-wrenching fear that keeps you up at night.</p>

        <p>It's not about the price. It's not about the halving.</p>

        <p>It's the question: <em>"What if something happens to me?"</em></p>

        <p>For me, that "what if" became a reality. And the pain of that loss was excruciating.</p>

        <p>It forced me to confront a hard truth. I had been so focused on the technical side of protecting my Bitcoin that I had ignored the biggest vulnerability of all.</p>

        <p><strong>Me.</strong></p>

        <p>That painful lesson sent me on a desperate search for answers. I was determined to understand how the wealthiest families in the world protect their assets for generations, and how others—just as wealthy—lost everything.</p>

        <p>I studied the systems of the Rockefellers. The Rothschilds. I dove into centuries of estate law. I dissected the horror stories of lost fortunes, from ancient Rome to modern-day crypto.</p>

        <p>And then, I saw it.</p>

        <p>The entire picture became crystal clear.</p>

        <p>I realized there are <strong>4 major threat areas</strong> that can wipe out your Bitcoin, and all the multi-sig wallets and hardware devices in the world can't protect you from them if you don't have a plan.</p>

        <p>What really shocked me was that every solution on the market was obsessed with only ONE of these areas—the technical side.</p>

        <p>They completely ignored the other, more likely risks: family feuds, lawsuits, natural disasters, government changes, and the biggest risk of all…</p>

        <p><strong>The "people problem."</strong></p>

        <p>People are the most vulnerable part of any setup. Your family, your lawyers, your partners… and you.</p>

        <p>Without a clear set of rules to follow, people make mistakes. They get emotional. They get greedy. They get scared.</p>

        <p>I realized that if something happened to me, I wouldn't want my son to just sell my Bitcoin. I needed rules in place to guide him. I needed a way to connect this digital thing to the physical world, so all the dots were connected for him.</p>

        <p>That's what forced me to create a set way of doing things—a repeatable system that could be passed down for generations.</p>

        <p>So… <strong>What if you could finally get peace of mind about your Bitcoin inheritance plan?</strong></p>

        <p>What if instead of just hoping your multi-sig is set up right…</p>

        <p>Or trusting that your family will "figure it out" when you're gone…</p>

        <p>You could get a comprehensive audit of your entire setup—exposing the hidden risks you haven't even thought of?</p>

        <p>Bitcoiners like us have too much at stake to just "wing it."</p>

        <p>Truth is, I hate complexity. The system I built for myself is brutally simple, but it's also robust. It's built on the same principles the world's wealthiest families have used for centuries.</p>

        <p>Now, over to you…</p>
