            <p>
                Your trust document says one thing. Your Bitcoin operations say another.
            </p>

            <p>
                A court will notice.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the gap that kills Bitcoin estates. You write a trust. You set up a multi-sig wallet. You create governance documents with key locations, recovery procedures, and successor instructions. Then life happens. You rotate a key. You change a timelock. You update who holds the backup. But the trust? It still references the original setup. Now there's a disconnect between what's legally binding and what's actually happening.
            </p>

            <p>
                When your heirs need to prove authority, they'll face a question no one wants to answer: <em>Which version is real?</em>
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem with Floating Governance</h2>

            <p>
                Most Bitcoin holders keep their operational documents separate from their legal instruments. The trust says "Bitcoin held in cold storage." A Google Doc somewhere describes the actual setup. Maybe a spreadsheet tracks key locations. Perhaps there's a PDF on an encrypted drive.
            </p>

            <p>
                None of it is legally anchored. None of it is auditable. And when someone challenges the arrangement, there's no chain of custody proving which document was authoritative at which point in time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Worse: anyone with access can quietly edit that governance file. Without cryptographic proof, there's no way to know if what you're reading is what the grantor approved.
            </p>

            <h2>One Hash. One Source of Truth.</h2>

            <p>
                The Trust Hash Amendment Protocol solves this with a simple mechanism: the trust itself references a cryptographic hash of your governance file.
            </p>

            <p>
                We call that governance file the <strong>Little Shard</strong>. It's an encrypted document containing everything your fiduciaries need to know—key locations, quorum rules, recovery procedures, successor roles. The trust doesn't contain these operational details. Instead, it contains a SHA-256 hash that points to the Little Shard like a fingerprint.
            </p>

            <p>
                Change one character in the file, and the hash changes completely. This makes tampering obvious and verification instant.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you need to update your governance—rotate a key, adjust a timelock, change a keyholder—you don't rewrite the trust. You create a new version of the Little Shard, generate its hash, timestamp it, and record that hash in the trust via a short amendment. Five minutes of legal work instead of five thousand dollars.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>

            <p>
                THAP follows five steps. No jargon. No complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>1. Draft.</strong> You and your KEEP Advisor create an updated Little Shard with a clear summary of what changed. This is version-controlled—v1.0, v1.1, v2.0—so the history is traceable.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. Hash.</strong> Generate a SHA-256 hash of the encrypted file. Then timestamp it using OpenTimestamps or equivalent. This proves the file existed at a specific moment in time.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Review.</strong> Your Trustee or Attorney of Record reviews the scope of changes. Minor governance tweaks proceed. Structural changes to beneficiaries or jurisdiction require separate legal work.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>4. Record.</strong> The attorney updates the trust's hash clause via a short amendment—just the new hash and date. No full rewrite. The trust now points to the current version.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>5. Archive.</strong> The prior hash and file are marked superseded. The Amendment Log is updated. Key parties are notified.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's it. The new governance file is now legally binding. The old one is archived but still verifiable. And you have a complete audit trail.
            </p>

            <h2>What Gets a Hash Update vs. What Needs More</h2>

            <p>
                Not every change is equal. THAP uses a simple decision matrix:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Hash update only:</strong> Governance tweaks like adjusting timers, changing quorum requirements, updating drill schedules. Keyholder roster changes within existing roles.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Requires separate trust amendment:</strong> Changes to beneficiaries, trustees, or jurisdiction. These are structural and need proper legal process.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Consider both:</strong> Replacing the Little Shard system entirely. This might need architectural changes to the trust alongside the hash update.
            </p>

            <h2>The Audit Trail That Holds Up</h2>

            <p>
                Every version of the Little Shard is documented:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md); padding-left: var(--space-md);">
                <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-sm);">File name and version number</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-sm);">SHA-256 hash</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-sm);">Timestamp proof</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-sm);">Approval signature from the attorney</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-sm);">Change summary in plain English</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This creates something Bitcoin estates have never had: <strong>auditable continuity</strong>. You can prove what governance was in effect on any given date. You can verify that no unauthorized changes were made. And you can demonstrate to any court, auditor, or skeptical heir that the chain of custody is intact.
            </p>

            <h2>The Trust Clause That Makes It Work</h2>

            <p>
                Here's the language that goes into your trust:
            </p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid var(--gold); padding-left: var(--space-md); margin: var(--space-lg) 0; font-style: italic; color: var(--gray-dark);">
                "This Trust incorporates by reference the document known as 'Little Shard' (the 'Governance File'), identified by cryptographic hash [HASH] as of [DATE]. Updates to the Governance File shall have no legal effect until the Trustee records the updated hash and date within this Trust or its attached Amendment Log. The most recently recorded hash shall be controlling."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Simple. Defensible. And it gives the Trustee clear authority to manage updates without ambiguity.
            </p>

            <h2>Questions We Hear</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Do I need a new trust every time something changes?</strong><br>
                No. You record a new hash via a short amendment. The trust structure stays intact.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Can someone change the file without going through the trust?</strong><br>
                They can draft whatever they want. But it's not legally binding until the new hash is recorded by the Trustee. The trust controls.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>What if two versions of the file exist?</strong><br>
                The trust's last recorded hash controls. Prior versions are archived and superseded. There's always one authoritative answer.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>How often should we review?</strong><br>
                Annually, at minimum. Also after major life events—births, deaths, divorces, significant Bitcoin accumulation, or changes to your custody setup.
            </p>

            <h2>Governance That Survives You</h2>

            <p>
                Most estate plans fail because they're static documents describing a dynamic system. The trust is written once. The Bitcoin setup evolves. And eventually the gap between them becomes a liability.
            </p>

            <p>
                THAP closes that gap. It gives you the flexibility to update your operational governance without the cost of rewriting legal documents. It gives your trustees a clear chain of authority. And it gives your heirs proof that what they're executing is exactly what you intended.
            </p>

            <p>
                One hash. One source of truth. Complete auditability.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's how Bitcoin governance survives its architect.
            </p>
